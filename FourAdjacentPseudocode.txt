//use a file.io input has.nextInt solution
//fill an array with every twelve 
//filter, if >certain value, take next 12 integers
//spit out output
//analyze which of these is max value
//find product


//values are horizontal only? Can use file.io and has.next
//or is.next or whatever Java uses (can't remember)

//MAKE SENSE OF GOOBLEYGOOK
//read in first thirteen numbers
//find product of those numbers
//read in next thirteen numbers and do the same
//if the product is larger than the previous product
//is more than the previous product\
//replace the old product with new product
//keep going until you run out of input file-ness :)
